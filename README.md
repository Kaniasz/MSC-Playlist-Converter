## ![Logo](src/resources/icon.png) MSC Playlist Converter

### Overview
MSC Playlist Converter is a Python tool i made using AI designed to simplify the downloading and conversion of audio tracks from YouTube and SoundCloud (Unfortunately no Spotify due to DRMðŸ˜”) into .ogg files for My Summer Car. The tool uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading and includes [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for audio conversion.

## Usage
1. Open the application
2. Enter a YouTube or SoundCloud playlist/track link in the input field
3. Select the output (Radio, CD1, CD2, CD3)
4. Optionally enable "High Quality" for better audio (High quality .ogg files take a VERY LONG time to import in MSC!)
5. Click "Start" to begin the download and conversion process

### Converting Local Files
- Use the "From Folder" button to select a directory containing audio files
- All supported audio files in the folder will be converted and added to the selected output

### Output Modes
- **Radio**: Adds tracks to the car radio folder
- **CD1/CD2/CD3**: Creates custom CDs with cover art support
- **Single Track Mode**: When downloading individual tracks, they're added to existing collections

### Supported Formats
- **Input**: YouTube/SoundCloud URLs, Local audio files via "From Folder" button
- **File Types**: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, AAC, M4A
