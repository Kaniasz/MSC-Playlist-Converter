## ![Logo](src/resources/icon.png) MSC Playlist Converter

### Overview
MSC Playlist Converter is a Python tool I made using AI designed to simplify the downloading and conversion of audio tracks from YouTube and SoundCloud (Unfortunately no Spotify due to DRM restrictionsðŸ˜”) into .ogg files for My Summer Car. The tool uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for downloading and includes [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for audio conversion.

## Usage
1. Open the application
2. Enter a YouTube or SoundCloud playlist/track link in the input field or select local audio files
3. Select the output (Radio, CD1, CD2, CD3)
4. Optionally enable "High Quality" for better audio (High quality .ogg files take a VERY LONG time to import in MSC!)
5. Click "Start" to begin the download and conversion process

### Converting Local Files
- Use the "Local Audio" button to select audio files
- All supported audio files will be converted and added to the selected output

### Output Modes
- **Radio**: Adds tracks to the car radio folder
- **CD1/CD2/CD3**: Creates custom CDs with cover art support
- **Single Track Mode**: When downloading individual tracks, they're added to existing collections

### Supported Formats
- **Input**: YouTube/SoundCloud URLs, Local audio files via "Local Audio" button
- **File Types**: MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, AAC, M4A
